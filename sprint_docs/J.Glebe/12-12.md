## Description of Sprint

(Sprint doc from 12/6-12/12) I worked on the ability to upload tagged locations with images, names, and geopoints.
That's really it for this section. Testing devices for master branch and individual branches with their features.
Made android builds work again. Rewrote user creation to include additional information. Includes creation time (at
request of Messaging team) and id as well as just looking a little nicer. Spent a very long time getting android
build to actually properly work. Fixed photos in android build and friends screen and add friends screen and profile
page and basically everything b/c the android build of our app was broken bad.
