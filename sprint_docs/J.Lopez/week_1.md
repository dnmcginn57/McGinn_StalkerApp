## Description of Sprint

I started working on a seperate project folder for a firebase provider. This project initialized a firebase; created, fetched and updated a user document;
created and fetched a location document; authenticated, logged in and logged out a user. HomePage was the test driver for the project. The
driver was event based, so buttons were used in HTML. This code was written to help write firebase branch. I also made a function list
for the firebase branch. Overview document was worked on for class on November 14, 2018.
